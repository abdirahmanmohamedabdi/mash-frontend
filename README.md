# Mash-Industries



## Problem Statement
Mash industries Ltd is a company manufacturing Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG)  such as Soap, Cooking Oil, etc. The company sales’ department has hundreds of salespeople named merchandisers reporting about their product insights to the HQ on a daily basis.
Having expanded their operations countrywide as well as in some neighboring countries a year ago, the company is now struggling to monitor the movement of their salespeople on duty, to the extent that a salesperson would report about their day to day activities without any tangible proof of their whereabouts during their time on duty.
